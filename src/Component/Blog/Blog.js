          Q1- What are the different ways to manage a state in a React
          application?
        </h1>
        <p>
          Ans:As your application grows, it helps to be more intentional about
          how your state is organized and how the data flows between your
          components. Redundant or duplicate state is a common source of bugs.
          In this chapter, youâ€™ll learn how to structure your state well, how to
          keep your state update logic maintainable, and how to share state
          between distant components.
